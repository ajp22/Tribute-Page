                <p><b>Benjamin Franklin</b> (January 17, 1706 â€“ April 17, 1790) was a British
                    American polymath and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Franklin was a leading
                    writer, printer, political philosopher, politician, Freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor,
                    humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the
                    American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding
                    electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove,
                    among other inventions. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company,
                    Philadelphia's first fire department, and the University of Pennsylvania.
